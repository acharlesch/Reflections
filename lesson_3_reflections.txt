When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to collaborate with other people, or ensure you can reach your content from different locations. 
Also it is a good idea if you have content that you want to ensure that it doesn't get lost.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may not have things ready to push and may be testing stuff that may break the code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - a copy of some else's repository into your github account
Clone - a copy of a git or github repository into your local machine
Branche - a copy of a repository to your local machine at a particular state
